# Automated Timesheet
### (For NEU Student Employment)

On Friday May 18, 2018, I grudgingly submitted my work-study timesheet for the week. There are just so many
darn buttons to click and options to select. The three-minutes I take filling it out could be spent on more productive activities.
Like a game of Tetris Battle.

So I made my computer do it for me.

<sub>In hindsight, I probably could have used a Chrome extension. But this was more fun.</sub>
