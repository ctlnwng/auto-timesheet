# Automated Timesheet
**(For NEU Student Employment)**

On Friday May 18, 2018, I grudgingly submitted my work-study timesheet for the week. There are just so many
darn buttons to click and options to select. The four minutes I take filling it out could be spent on more productive activities...like a game of Tetris Battle.

So I made my computer do it for me.
